Therefore, I am going to analyze the safety, neighborhood and the market trend of housing price in Toronto as well. However, I am not sure, where I can get relevant raw data for each section and how I can manipulate the data to get the result and use the right tools I learned for plotting location and charts. These things will be my challenge."
